# Hurricanes since 1851
A detailed map projection showcasing the projected paths and frequencies of hurricanes worldwide since 1851, providing a comprehensive view of historical hurricane patterns.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

First, I gathered four datasets: the NASA basemap image, NOAA historic hurricanes, coastlines and graticules, and Firefly icon images. To create an engaging visual experience, I selected the South Pole Stereographic Projection. This projection highlights the circular structure of the numerous storms worldwide, emphasizing the density in the Northern Hemisphere.

Next, I modified the basemap to be darker and more saturated, enhancing the contrast with the bright hurricane points. I made the grayscale of the basemap slightly transparent, allowing a hint of color to show through.

I then added the Firefly icons in the Content pane, linking the images to the points representing the hurricanes. To enhance the map's visual appeal and focus, I added a vignette at the center.

At the bottom of the map, I included a bar chart comparing data counts by year. Below the chart, I added annotation text to provide context on the history of hurricanes and how measurement methods have evolved over time. This combination of visual elements and informative text helps create a comprehensive and engaging representation of the data.

## Optimizations

Increasing the font size for the title could help draw more attention to it without detracting from the map. This adjustment is subtle and should be unobtrusive, enhancing the overall presentation without overwhelming the visual elements.

## Lessons Learned:

What I've learned here is the importance of going beyond the basics and experimenting. When creating a map, I considered it from a viewer's perspective. If I had made a basic map of hurricanes with only minor quality-of-life changes, it would have been readable but dull, and the impact of the information would have been lost. Instead of presenting mere data points, I aimed to create a map that vividly depicts roaring hurricanes.

While the basics are crucial, art and presentation significantly enhance how the message is conveyed to viewers. This approach can inspire curiosity about the topic and even motivate action. Small details can make a big difference in effective storytelling through maps. The skills I've learned in basemap and icon construction have taught me to be intentional in my mapmaking, ensuring that every element contributes to a compelling and informative visual narrative.
