## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

First, I gathered four datasets: the NASA basemap image, NOAA historic hurricanes, coastlines and graticules, and Firefly icon images. To create an engaging visual experience, I selected the South Pole Stereographic Projection. This projection highlights the circular structure of the numerous storms worldwide, emphasizing the density in the Northern Hemisphere.

Next, I modified the basemap to be darker and more saturated, enhancing the contrast with the bright hurricane points. I made the grayscale of the basemap slightly transparent, allowing a hint of color to show through.

I then added the Firefly icons in the Content pane, linking the images to the points representing the hurricanes. To enhance the map's visual appeal and focus, I added a vignette at the center.

At the bottom of the map, I included a bar chart comparing data counts by year. Below the chart, I added annotation text to provide context on the history of hurricanes and how measurement methods have evolved over time. This combination of visual elements and informative text helps create a comprehensive and engaging representation of the data.

## Optimizations

Increasing the font size for the title could help draw more attention to it without detracting from the map. This adjustment is subtle and should be unobtrusive, enhancing the overall presentation without overwhelming the visual elements.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
